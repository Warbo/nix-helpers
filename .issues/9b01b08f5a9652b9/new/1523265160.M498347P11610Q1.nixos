Subject: Add IPFS fallbacks for latestGit and other URLs
Message-Id: <9b01b08f5a9652b9-0-artemis@nixos>

We want to eventually wean ourselves off HTTP altogether, since IPFS is
more robust (we keep hosting it ourselves even if the original server
disappears) and faster (previous downloads are cached locally).
