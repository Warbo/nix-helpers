# Nix Helpers #

This repository collects up useful functions and other bits and pieces for the
[Nix](http://nixos.org/nix) language.

Some of these may be suitable for including in the official nixpkgs repository,
but others may be too hacky and/or experimental. Note that this repository isn't
necessarily stable, so it's recommended to pin a particular git revision if you
depend on it.

The goals of this project are:

 - Complement nixpkgs by providing an "overlay" of useful helper utilities
 - Avoid packaging end-user software, since that's best done elsewhere
 - Have few external dependencies
 - Work across Nix and nixpkgs versions

Bug reports and patches are welcome! These can be emailed to
chriswarbo@gmail.com either as normal emails or via `git send-email`. Issues are
tracked in git too, using [Artemis](http://mrzv.org/software/artemis), so they
can be included in a patch if you like.
