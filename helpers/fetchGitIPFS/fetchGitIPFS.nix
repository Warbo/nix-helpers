fetchGitIPFS.nix version >= 2025-03-20T21:00:00Z

This file provides a Nix function called 'fetchGitIPFS' to fetch Git trees from
IPFS HTTP gateways. It has the following design goals:

 - Be easily fetched from IPFS. Hence it's all in one self-contained file.
 - Be usable from a bare Nix expression. In particular, no dependencies need to
   be passed in (whether as function arguments, or impurely like <nixpkgs>).
 - Allow dependencies to be passed in, to override any baked-in defaults. These
   are optional arguments, to avoid conflicting with the previous goal.
 - Avoid relying on URLs. Support fallbacks, overrides and caches.
 - Be relatively stable and unchanging.
   - It's easier to fetch from IPFS when seeding resources aren't spread across
     many different versions.
   - Allowing dependencies to be overridden helps, since those can be updated by
     users as desired, rather than bumping version numbers in this script.
   - Supporting fallbacks, overrides and caches allows this script to keep on
     working, even after hosts have shut down, domains have expired, etc.

Here's an example usage, for "bootstrapping" a project's dependencies from IPFS:

    with rec {
      fetchGitIPFS = import (builtins.fetchTree {
        type = "file";
        url = "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/CID_OF_THIS_FILE";
        narHash = NAR_HASH_OF_THIS_FILE;
      });
      inherit (fetchGitIPFS {
                mkPkgs = { fetchGitIPFS, ... }:
                  import (fetchGitIPFS { sha1 = MY_NIXPKGS_TREE_ID; })
                    { config = {}; overlays = []; };
                sha1 = {
                  myFirstDependency = ITS_GIT_TREE_ID;
                  mySecondDependency = ITS_GIT_TREE_ID;
                };
              })
        myFirstDependency mySecondDependency pkgs;
    };
    ...

In principle, fetching this file from IPFS allows anyone to contribute to its
hosting; and to resurrect files which have otherwise disappeared. Unfortunately,
none of Nix's builtin fetchers support fallback URLs (as of version 2.26); so we
recommend the (commonly used) ipfs.io gateway, along with 'builtins.fetchTree'
and a 'narHash'. This combination lets Nix query its caches first; which, in
principle, gives anyone a mechanism to bypass the ipfs.io URL and resurrect this
file if it disappears, e.g. by fetching it from another IPFS node or gateway,
and manually inserting it into their store/cache.

The fetchFromIPFS function defined in this file defaults to querying a local
IPFS gateway, which explicitly avoids dependency on a third-party. In the common
case that there is no local gateway, it falls back to an overridable list of
public gateways, to further reduce reliance on a single domain. It also relies
on Fixed Output Derivations (FODs), which can be fetched from Nix caches without
needing IPFS; and are also robust to changes in their implementation (since they
are identified by output hash, so their inputs can vary without invalidating any
cached copies).

## Fetching Git trees ##

The result of importing this file is a "functor" (an attrset which can be called
as if it were a lambda), which is the fetchGitIPFS function. It can be called in
several ways, depending on what's most convenient. In every case, an attrset
must be given as argument: all attributes are optional.

If the 'sha1' argument is a string containing the SHA1 of a Git tree, written in
hex, like 'sha1 = "f4527832148dd6894fe856fde1c65df822a7529d";' then the result
will be a fixed-output derivation (FOD) for fetching that Git tree from IPFS.

Instead of 'sha1' we can give 'sha256': this is supported by Git, but Nix does
not yet support git-hashing with SHA256 (as of Nix 2.26). Finally, a 'hash'
argument can be given instead, which is parsed by Nix's 'convertHash' function
(allowing SRI format, etc.).

Only one 'sha1', 'sha256' or 'hash' string can be given, to avoid ambiguity. If
you want to fetch multiple trees, wrap the hashes in attrsets: those can be
nested to any depth, but to avoid ambiguity the "path" of each string/hash must
be unique, e.g. '{ sha1.foo.bar = "..."; hash.foo.bar = "..."; }' is not allowed
but '{ sha1.foo.bar = "..."; hash.foo.baz = "..."; }' is fine.

## The result ##

If a string is given for 'sha1', 'sha256' or 'hash' then the result is a FOD for
that Git tree.

If 'sha1', 'sha256' or 'hash' was an attrset, then the result will contain a FOD
for each of their strings/hashes; structured in the same way; hence the example
above would contain a FOD at 'foo.bar' and another at 'foo.baz'. This also works
when the whole result is a FOD, e.g. '{ sha1 = "..."; hash.foo = "..."; }' will
result in a FOD, and there will be another in its 'foo' attribute.

The result will always contain a 'fetchGitIPFS' attribute. Normally its value is
the fetchGitIPFS function, though it can get replaced e.g. if we used input like
'sha1.fetchGitIPFS = "...";'. If any overrides were given (see section below),
then the resulting function will use those values as its defaults. This is
useful for specialising the fetchGitIPFS function, to avoid having to override
it at every call site; for example:

    with { inherit (import THIS_FILE { pkgs = myPkgs; }) fetchGitIPFS; };
    fetchGitIPFS { sha1 = "..."; }  # Takes dependencies from myPkgs

If the output is not a FOD (i.e. it was not given a string for 'sha1', 'sha256'
or 'hash') then the same 'fetchGitIPFS' value is available as '__functor'. This
allows the result to be called directly as a function. Note that an attrset with
a '__functor' attribute will not be built by the 'nix-build' command, since it's
considered to be a function rather than a derivation or set of derivations. This
is why we do not include '__functor' when the result is a FOD.

Finally, a 'pkgs' attribute is included. As long as it's not been replaced (e.g.
by giving 'sha1.pkgs = "...";') then its value will be the Nixpkgs attribute set
used for the dependencies of fetchGitIPFS. This defaults to a pinned version,
but can be overridden (see section below). We include this in the output so that
overrides calling fetchGitIPFS recursively don't need to be repeated, like
'{ mkPkgs = { fetchGitIPFS }: import (fetchGitIPFS ...) {}; sha1.pkgs = ...; }'.
Alternatively, we can use the default 'pkgs' as is, if we don't want to pin our
own version; e.g.

    with rec {
      inherit (import THIS_FILE { sha1.deps.a = "..."; sha1.deps.b = "..."; })
        deps pkgs;
      defaultPkgs = pkgs;
    };
    { pkgs ? defaultPkgs, a ? deps.a, b ? deps.b }: pkgs.mkStdDerivation {...}

## Overriding implementation details ##

Providing an argument called 'gateways', as a list of strings, will cause
fetchGitIPFS to try fetching its CAR files from those URLs, in order. If not
provided, a default list of gateways will be tried; starting with
"http://127.0.0.1:8080" (in case there's a local gateway) then "https://ipfs.io"
(a commonly used public gateway).

If we have a Nixpkgs attrset (e.g. imported from <nixpkgs>), give it as a 'pkgs'
argument to have fetchGitIPFS use it instead of its built-in default. It will
also be returned in a 'pkgs' attribute (unless replaced by a hash with the same
name). Overriding 'pkgs' is useful to avoid having multiple out-of-date copies
of Nixpkgs on your system. If you don't have a Nixpkgs attrset available, and
want to get one using fetchGitIPFS itself, then provide a 'mkPkgs' argument
instead (e.g. like the examples above). To avoid infinite recursion, the
'fetchGitIPFS' argument given to 'mkPkgs' uses the default pkgs, so may cause
that to be downloaded; however, that can be garbage-collected once the desired
Nixpkgs has been "bootstrapped" into your store or a cache.

fetchGitIPFS uses a program called go-car which is not provided by its default
pkgs attrset. A specific implementation can be given via the 'go-car' argument;
or a 'mkGoCar' argument can be given as a function from '{ pkgs, fetchGitIPFS }'
to a go-car implementation. The default 'mkGoCar' will return 'pkgs.go-car', if
that exists; or otherwise use 'pkgs' to build a particular version. Its 'pkgs'
argument will be the overridden version, so you can also use 'pkgs' or 'mkPkgs'
to provide a 'go-car' attribute, instead of overriding 'go-car' or 'mkGoCar'.
