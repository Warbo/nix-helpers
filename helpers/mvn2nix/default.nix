# mvn2nix creates a "lock file" specifying the dependencies of a Maven project.
# It provides a derivation, but its pinned dependencies are out of date; which
# unfortunately makes its lock files incompatible with newer versions of Maven
# (in particular it locks old versions of maven-resources-plugin, so newer Maven
# versions can't find the new version that they need).
# We overcome that by re-bootstrapping.
